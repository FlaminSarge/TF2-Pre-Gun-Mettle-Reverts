# Pre-Gun-Mettle-Reverts

This is a SourceMod plugin that reverts weapon attributes to just before Gun Mettle (July 2 2015), as accurately as possible. This is my first ever SM plugin, so it may not be perfect, but I think it's going pretty well. :)

This plugin has been influenced not only by my somehow massive interest in TF2's old mechanics, but also by a plugin called Weapon Reverts by bakugo (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2717299). I really enjoyed playing on servers with this plugin, and I thought about writing my own historically-accurate plugin with as many reverts as possible. Thank you bakugo :).

## Dependencies:
- asherkin's TF2Items extension.
- Dr!fter's DHooks extension (already a part of SourceMod since version 1.1). You'll need a version that has support for detours.

## Credits.
- Thank you to nosoop for providing samples of code (functions used for memory management in this case) with your stocksoup plugin (https://github.com/nosoop/stocksoup)!
